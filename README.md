- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm ‚ÄúArmin Nabaei,‚Äù a Machine learning engineer who developed and launched the cutting-edge algorithms that power the platform‚Äôs core services. During previous years, I have created predictive models and machine learning algorithms. 
   I consistently reviewed large amounts of information to discover effective patterns and trends. Hence, I built infrastructure for training, evaluating, and serving models.
   With many years of experience in coding, I received sufficient knowledge in project experience working with Python development eco-systems, including opencv, numpy, scipy, pandas, sklearn, etc., and implementing in Keras, Tensorflow, and Pytorch frameworks. I clearly grasped introductory linear algebra, optimization, statistics, and algorithms. 
   I have a strong understanding of machine learning methodologies, including supervised learning, forecasting, recommendation systems, generative adversarial networks, reinforcement learning, and multi-armed bandits. I used this knowledge to implement state-of-the-art models from research papers.
   My passion for R&D opportunities is to build machine learning-based tools to accelerate the solution of optimization problems encountered in real-time operation. I‚Äôm interested in solving problems of building reliable machine learning models with noisy data and data scarcity.
